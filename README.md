**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
