# CodeWars Challenges: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewars.com/users/XxHMu54" >Visit Here</a> 

A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). Push a minimum of 5 solutions every week.

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Every day, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar! 

## Optimizations
- Looking at best practices, spend time understanding that code and how to apply it to my code going forward.
- Consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, and sometimes for readability.
